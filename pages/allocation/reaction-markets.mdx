# Reaction Markets [Engagement as allocation]

import { ReactionMarketDemo } from "../../components/ReactionMarketDemo";

Reaction markets on Cobuild turn every like, comment, and follow into a micro-purchase.
You configure a budget, set amounts per reaction type, and from then on your normal social behavior automatically allocates capital to the creators you engage with.

## How it works

You set rules for each reaction type: maybe $0.10 per like, $0.20 per comment, $0.40 per follow.
When you engage with a creator, we batch those micro-buys and swap your money for their token.

The creator gets direct financial signal that their work is valued; you get a portfolio that perfectly reflects your genuine interests.

## Why it matters

Traditional capital allocation suffers from a fundamental disconnect: the people deciding where money goes are rarely the same people consuming and valuing the work.
Grant committees, VCs, and institutional investors are one or two steps removed from the grassroots signal of what's actually resonating.

Social engagement is the purest form of bottom-up signal we have.
When you like something, you're expressing genuine attention and approval: a micro-judgment that this creator is producing value worth your time.
But historically, that signal has been worthless for capital allocation.
It gets aggregated into vanity metrics that mean nothing to the creator's bank account.

Reaction markets close the loop.
Your attention becomes capital.
Instead of likes being empty gestures and investments being detached decisions, they merge into a single action.

The result is a capital allocation system that routes money exactly where organic human interest already flows.
No committees, no applications, no gatekeepers.

This is what market-like allocation looks like for social goods: millions of tiny, honest judgments aggregating into real capital flows.
**No central allocator could ever match the information density of organic engagement at scale.**
