# Capital Allocation [Scaling global coordination]

Until very recently, humanity was limited in the size and scope of the organizations we could build.

With new coordination technology (the internet, AI, and programmable money) we believe it's now possible to accurately fund hundreds of thousands of people working toward a common goal, all with no slow-moving hierarchy.

Our core bet: if we build a capital allocation machine for grassroots work that functions as well as markets do for private goods, fundraising becomes relatively easy. The real gap isn't funding, it's the feedback loops that markets provide for things you buy, but almost never exist for things we share.

## Markets as compression

Markets turn millions of tiny, local judgments into a single global signal: price. No central planner needed. The loop of "produce → spend → consume" continuously pushes capital toward what actually works.

Markets work because they combine skin in the game with rich, bottom-up signaling. We're importing that same feedback (real money, real preferences, real downside for being wrong) into domains without a clean buyer-seller relationship.

## The funding desert

Most people doing interesting work outside clearly profitable enterprises (open‑source devs, movement builders, indie researchers, local organizers, artists) have no "customer pays X for Y" moment that tells the world what their work is worth. Instead: likes and retweets, opaque grant committees, one‑off donors chasing narratives. None with tight feedback loops.

We're building market-like structures so that funding public, cultural, collective things can feel as sharp, honest, and efficient as capital allocation in the best private markets.
