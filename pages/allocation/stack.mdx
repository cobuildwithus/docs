# Cobuild Capital Allocation [Our stack for effective grants]

Since 2021, we've been building systems to help communities fund what matters to them.
Our two flagship systems, [Flows](/allocation/flows) and [Rounds](/allocation/rounds), were engineered to provide accurate, efficient, and fair grants to people making grassroots impact for their communities.

## Diverse strategies

There's no one-size-fits-all solution for funding impactful work.
Different allocation strategies are necessary to fund the wide range of efforts that help these organizations scale and sustain.

Rounds funds micro-bounties for one-off tasks.
Flows funds longer term small stipends for continuous work.

We've designed these systems to enable supporters to fund work directly, so builders on the ground can raise funds for themselves and their communities effortlessly while integrating valuable market signals into our allocation systems.

[Reaction markets](/allocation/reaction-markets) are our first primitive.
They turn social engagement into micro-purchases that generate the bottom-up signal Flows and Rounds need to allocate accurately.
