# Cobuild with us [Our vision for the future]

Our vision is a world where millions of people earn a living advancing missions they care about.
Our hope is that we can **rewrite civilization’s reward function away from maximizing profit and more explicitly toward human values.**

- Subcultures → sovereign, economically real networks

- Jobs → missions inside cultures you care about

- Firms → networks owned by participants

- Incentives → aligned with values, not just profit

- Cobuild → the coordination engine making this all actually work

The old world is stuck in a coordination trap; the new one is begging to be born.
We now have the tools to replace the Firm with the Network, the Job with the Mission, and the Manager with Crowd Intelligence.

Cobuild is for people who want to step out of the race to the bottom and build the next generation of organizations that maximize our shared humanity and values.
