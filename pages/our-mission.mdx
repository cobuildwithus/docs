# Our Mission [What we're building toward]

**Our mission is to increase community-driven impact in the world.**

Today's institutions weren't designed for the intelligence age.
The firm was a workaround for expensive coordination, where hierarchy replaced markets because finding and trusting strangers was slow and costly.
That constraint is gone.

The internet gave us global affinity.
Blockchains gave us shared ownership.
AI gave us abundant judgment.
We now have everything we need to replace the firm with the network.

## Our beliefs

**Networks, not firms.**
The best work happens in communities of shared belief, not corporate org charts.
We build infrastructure for networks to hold assets, make decisions, and reward contributors.

**Meaning, not just profit.**
People want to give their full effort to something that matters.
The next great organizations won't sell products; they'll co-create culture.
We give these communities economic rails.

**Bottom-up allocation.**
Markets work because they aggregate millions of small judgments into accurate prices.
Grants fail because committees can't scale.
We build market-like primitives that route capital to where organic attention and value already flow.

**Permissionless by default.**
Anyone can contribute. Anyone can earn. Anyone can build.
No gatekeepers deciding who gets to participate in the upside.

**Transparent rules, not opaque bureaucracy.**
Smart contracts let us encode allocation logic that everyone can inspect and no one can unilaterally override.

**Owned by builders, not just funders.**
We believe the best global movements will be owned by their builders as much as they're owned by the people contributing capital.
You should be able to earn a vote for your efforts and steer the energy of the movement you're contributing to.

## The bet

If we can allocate capital as accurately as markets do, but for work that doesn't have a price tag, fundraising becomes easy and millions of people can earn a living advancing missions they actually believe in.

We're building the coordination engine that enables this future.
