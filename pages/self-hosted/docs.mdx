## Populate the docs search vector store

If you use the Chat API’s docs tool, you can upload these docs into an OpenAI vector store and point the tool at that store ID.

The repo includes an upload script that collects all `.md`/`.mdx` files under `pages/` (excluding legal pages) and pushes them to a vector store.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... DOCS_VECTOR_STORE_ID=... pnpm upload-docs
```

Notes:

- Omit `DOCS_VECTOR_STORE_ID` to create a new store (named “Cobuild Docs”).
- Add `--purge` to remove existing vector store files before re-uploading.
- Add `--vector-store-id=vs_...` to target a specific store.
- Add `--keep-files` to keep underlying file objects after purge.
- Optional headers: `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` and `OPENAI_PROJECT` are supported.

Once uploaded, configure the Chat API docs tool with the resulting vector store ID so it can power docs search.

## LLM-friendly exports

We publish `llms.txt` and the full-text export (`llms-full.txt`) on docs.co.build. The canonical entrypoint is `docs.co.build/llms.txt`.
