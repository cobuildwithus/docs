# Chat API

The Chat API is a minimal chat service that powers Cobuild’s chat UX. It exposes a small HTTP surface, persists chats/messages, and optionally uses tools like Farcaster lookups.

Repository: [github.com/cobuildwithus/chat-api](https://github.com/cobuildwithus/chat-api)

## What it does

- Streams chat responses from the configured model.
- Creates and lists chats, and fetches chat history by ID.
- Persists chats/messages in Postgres and uses Redis for caching/rate limits.
- Supports optional Farcaster tools (Neynar API key).

## Endpoints

- `POST /api/chat` (streaming chat)
- `POST /api/chat/new` (create chat)
- `GET /api/chats` (list chats)
- `GET /api/chat/:chatId` (read chat)

## Auth modes

### Privy (default)

Provide a `privy-id-token` header on requests. The API resolves the user address via Privy.

### Self-hosted mode

Set `SELF_HOSTED_MODE=true` and either:
- Send `x-chat-user: <evm_address>` per request, or
- Set `SELF_HOSTED_DEFAULT_ADDRESS` once and omit the header.

Optional hardening: set `SELF_HOSTED_SHARED_SECRET` and require callers to send `x-chat-auth`.

## Data stores

- **Postgres**: chat + message storage.
- **Redis**: caching and rate limiting.

## Docs tool (optional)

If you enable the docs search tool, populate an OpenAI vector store with the Cobuild docs and point the tool at that store ID. The docs repo includes a script to pull and upload all pages into a vector store; follow the steps on [Docs Repo](/self-hosted/docs) to generate the vector store and keep it updated.

## Built with

- Fastify (HTTP server)
- Drizzle ORM + Postgres
- Redis
- Vercel AI SDK + OpenAI Responses API
- Zod
- Neynar SDK (optional Farcaster tools)

## Minimal database schema

The repo includes a minimal migration you can apply directly:

- [migrations/0001_minimal_chat.sql](https://github.com/cobuildwithus/chat-api/blob/main/migrations/0001_minimal_chat.sql)

Run it with:

```bash
psql "$COBUILD_POSTGRES_URL" -f migrations/0001_minimal_chat.sql
```

The migration also creates a minimal `farcaster.profiles` table for the `getUser` tool. You can leave it empty if you don’t use Farcaster tools.

## Required configuration

At a minimum you’ll need:

- `COBUILD_POSTGRES_URL`
- `COBUILD_REDIS_URL`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `CHAT_GRANT_SECRET`

Privy config is required unless you use self-hosted mode.

Generate a `CHAT_GRANT_SECRET` with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

For full setup, env variables, and deployment tips, follow the README in the repo.
