# Open Infra

Running Cobuild services yourself aligns with the [Bill of Rights](/bill-of-rights): permissionless access, self‑custody, verifiability, and privacy. We want anyone to run core infrastructure without asking permission or relying on centralized gatekeepers.

Self-hosted docs are focused on practical steps for running Cobuild services in your own environment.
