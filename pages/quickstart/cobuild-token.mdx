# $COBUILD [Our network's token]

import { CobuildNetworkDiagram } from "../../components/CobuildNetworkDiagram";

$COBUILD is the token backing the Cobuild network. We plan to launch it soon.

<CobuildNetworkDiagram />

Cobuild is a launchpad for the next generation of organizations, with $COBUILD at the center of the economy.

- Networks launched on Cobuild use $COBUILD as their base trading pair
- A percentage of newly minted tokens seed LP positions, adding first-party liquidity. Trading fees from this liquidity route to the Cobuild revnet.
- [Social-swaps](/allocation/reaction-markets) that buy tokens in-feed on Farcaster and Twitter pay a small fee to buy $COBUILD for the user.
- Any [TCR-based](/allocation/flows) governance use $COBUILD or tokens denominated in it

## Stack

Cobuild tokens are built on top of [Revnets](https://revnet.app/) - autonomous revenue networks that tokenize payments with locked issuance and cash-out terms across stages.

Revnets are built on [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/), the programmable treasury protocol behind [ConstitutionDAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConstitutionDAO) - the historic crowdfund that raised $47M in under a week to bid on a copy of the U.S. Constitution.

This stack gives Cobuild tokens battle-tested, audited smart contracts that have processed hundreds of millions in onchain payments.
