# What is Cobuild

import { CobuildMechanismDemo } from "../../components/cobuild-mechanism-demo";

> **Cobuild** /ˈkōˌbild/ _proper noun_ — A coordination engine to build meaningful meritocracies at scale.

Cobuild provides the economic rails for communities to fundraise, align members, and allocate capital transparently
to thousands of contributors all over the world.

> _cobuild_ /ˈkōˌbild/ _noun_ — A mission-aligned community owned by its contributors with capacity for large-scale collective action in the world.

## How a cobuild works

A token is launched with fair issuance and a shared treasury.
When tokens are minted, a percentage automatically goes to contributors. [AI](/allocation/rounds#how-it-works) and [in-feed](/allocation/reaction-markets) quadratic funding identify who's growing the network and split the rewards accordingly.

### Fundraising

A community launches a token backed by a shared treasury with no governance except for four simple rules.

1. **Pay in (issuance)** — Anyone can pay the network in an accepted base asset. The contract mints tokens at the current issuance price; an optional split routes a fixed percent of new tokens to preset recipients. Funds remain in the treasury.

2. **Cash out (redemption)** — A holder burns tokens to reclaim treasury funds. A stage-defined cash-out tax keeps part of the redeemable value in the treasury, raising the future floor for remaining holders.

3. **Borrow (loans)** — Instead of cashing out, a holder can borrow from the treasury against their tokens. The borrowable amount is capped by that collateral's cash-out value.

4. **Split (builder funding)** — A share of all newly minted tokens is routed to builders growing the network.

When someone buys a product, tips a creator, or routes revenue through the network, the treasury grows and the floor rises for every holder. When you mint new tokens, you can decide what initiatives to fund with your builder share.

### Allocating Capital

Builders are paid to grow the network with a share of newly minted tokens.
We use a combination of LLM-driven pairwise duels and quadratically weighted social signals to allocate capital.

When you like or comment on a builder's update, you're micro-purchasing tokens that go directly to them.
These engagement signals are quadratically weighted so many small endorsements beat a few large ones.

- Anyone can propose ideas for how to spend tokens
- Anyone can get paid to help realize the mission
- The best contributions are paid fairly and openly

Money in, money out, all visible onchain. Revenue grows the floor, engagement routes capital to builders, builders ship more, the network earns more. A flywheel that lets anyone fund or earn a living advancing missions they believe in.
