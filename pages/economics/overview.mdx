# Cobuild Token Economics

Cobuild tokens are built on top of [Revnets](https://revnet.app/) - autonomous revenue networks that tokenize payments with locked issuance and cash-out terms across stages.

Revnets are built on [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/), the programmable treasury protocol behind [ConstitutionDAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConstitutionDAO) - the historic crowdfund that raised $47M in under a week to bid on a copy of the U.S. Constitution.

This stack gives Cobuild tokens battle-tested, audited smart contracts that have processed hundreds of millions in onchain payments.
