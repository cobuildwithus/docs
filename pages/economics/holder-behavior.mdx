# Holder Behavior Modeling

import { StrategyHeatmap } from "../../components/StrategyHeatmap";

This page models how economically rational participants might behave given a cobuild's mechanism design—choosing between **redeeming**, **holding**, or **borrowing** based on network outcomes.

## Three Available Actions

At any time, a holder with `q` tokens has three options:

**1. Redeem**

Burn tokens for a share of the treasury (paying the cash-out tax) or sell on an AMM at market price (which arbitrage keeps between floor and ceiling).

**2. Hold**

Take no action and remain exposed to future changes in floor / AMM price.

**3. Borrow**

Burn tokens as collateral, borrow less than their cash-out value, and optionally repay later to remint. Because loans are priced off the same convex redemption curve, they are always over-collateralized; the system remains solvent even if all loans default.

The stage parameters determine which action is individually rational under different scenarios.

## Immediate Liquidity Needs

First, consider a purely **myopic** scenario where future expectations are ignored. A participant simply asks:

> "I need liquidity now. Should I redeem or borrow?"

The relevant variables are:

- **Cash-out tax** `rₖ`
- **Net loan proceeds factor** `a` (what % of collateral's cash-out value is received after fees)
- **Position size as fraction of supply** `x = q / S`

### Redemption vs Borrowing

When cash-out tax is below ~39%, redeeming yields more immediate liquidity than borrowing. Most cobuilds use 10–20% tax, so in practice: **for immediate liquidity needs, redemption dominates.**

Only at very high taxes (40%+) does borrowing begin to compete for large holders seeking immediate liquidity.

## Forward-Looking Scenarios

Now consider participants who account for expected outcomes between **time `t₀`** and **future time `t₁`**.

Three variables matter:

- **External opportunity cost `R`** — alternative yield available elsewhere (DeFi, treasuries, etc.)
- **Expected token appreciation** — floor / AMM price growth between `t₀` and `t₁`
- **Loan fee level `a`** — net proceeds as fraction of collateral value

We model three outcome scenarios:

1. **Unsuccessful network** — token underperforms alternatives
2. **Moderate success** — steady but modest appreciation
3. **Strong success** — sustained compounding over years

## Unsuccessful Network Scenario

In this model, participants believe:

- "Alternative opportunities outperform this token."

Formally, redemption beats holding when:

```text
(1 + R) > P_sell(t₁, q) / P_sell(t₀, q)
```

In this scenario:

- **Redemption dominates holding** — If expected token appreciation is worse than external yield, rational behavior is to redeem and reallocate.

- **Borrowing vs holding** — For participants who want to maintain some exposure while reallocating capital, borrowing only beats holding if external return `R` clears the fee threshold:

  ```text
  R > (1 − a) / a
  ```

  With default loan parameters:
  - **6-month loan (`a ≈ 0.94`)** — Requires ~6% return over 6 months (~12% annualized)
  - **10-year loan (`a ≈ 0.63`)** — Requires ~60% total return over 10 years (~5–6% annualized)

In an unsuccessful network model:

> **Most rational participants redeem.**
> Borrowing only makes sense if external yield is genuinely attractive _and_ the participant wants to maintain some token exposure.

## Moderate Success Scenario

Assume the network performs adequately:

- Floor / AMM price drifts up over time
- But not by large multiples

With **minimal external yield** (`R ≈ 0`), the key comparison is **borrowing vs redemption**.

With no external yield, borrowing only makes sense if expected token appreciation beats the loan fee.

For typical parameters:

- **6-month loan (`a ≈ 0.94`)** — Requires ~6% floor / price growth in 6 months (~11–12% annualized)

- **10-year loan (`a ≈ 0.63`)** — Requires ~37% total floor growth over 10 years (~3–4% annualized)

In a moderate success model where floor growth of ~4–5% annually seems plausible:

- **Holding** is rational over redeeming
- **10-year loans** become viable: slow but steady growth covers the loan fee, and borrowed capital can be deployed elsewhere

If expected growth is below ~3% annually:

- **Holding** may still be rational for those who value the exposure
- **Loans add little value** unless external yield `R` is non-trivial

## Strong Success Scenario

This models a network that achieves product-market fit: real revenue and a floor that compounds over years.

### Redemption vs Holding

Holding beats redemption when expected appreciation exceeds external opportunity cost:

```text
Hold beats Redeem when:
P_sell(t₁, q) / P_sell(t₀, q) > (1 + R)
```

In this regime, optimistic participants hold or acquire more. Redemption is for those who believe they can do better elsewhere.

### Loan Thresholds

Two thresholds emerge:

- **Borrowing vs Holding**

  For participants maintaining exposure either way, borrowing beats simply holding when external return on borrowed capital clears:

  ```text
  R > (1 − a) / a
  ```

  For a 10-year window (`a ≈ 0.63`), that's the **~60% total over 10 years (~5–6%/yr)** threshold. Once external yield beats that, **"hold + borrow"** strictly dominates **"just hold"**.

- **Borrowing vs Redemption (with `R ≈ 0`)**

  If external opportunities are limited and loans are mainly used to access liquidity sooner, the relevant condition is that token appreciation beats the fee: roughly **~37% total over 10 years (~3–4%/yr)** for long-dated loans.

In other words:

- If token growth of **~1.4× over 10 years** (~3–4% annualized) seems plausible, long-dated loans are individually rational vs immediate redemption.
- If external yield of **~5–6% annually** is achievable, loans become compelling vs just holding—participants keep exposure _and_ earn yield on borrowed capital.

Both conditions can easily hold in a successful network, so rational behavior in this scenario is:

- **Don't redeem**
- **Do hold**
- **Use loans opportunistically** when good external opportunities or liquidity needs arise

## Parameter Effects

<StrategyHeatmap />

Stage parameters don't just change the math—they also signal what _kind_ of behavior the network is designed for.

### Cash-out Tax

| Tax Range            | Behavioral Signal                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low (~0–10%)**     | "If you're bearish or need liquidity, you can leave cheaply." Expect more **redemptions**, less loan usage, more trading & churn.               |
| **Medium (~10–20%)** | Balanced regime: redemption is still viable, loans are usable, and each redemption pushes the floor up meaningfully.                            |
| **High (≳20–40%+)**  | You're heavily penalizing redemption. Large rational holders are nudged toward **loans** over redemptions for liquidity, especially short-term. |

Higher cash-out taxes discourage immediate redemption, but also require stronger long-term growth to make loans worthwhile versus just leaving.

### Issuance Growth

- Faster issuance cuts (steeper ceiling) create more growth potential and make **holding + borrowing** more attractive if the network succeeds.
- But if the ceiling outruns reality for too long, you enter the **"runaway" regime**:
  - new issuance effectively stops
  - inbound flows mostly route through the AMM
  - AMM liquidity can thin out if demand is mostly speculative

Calibrating the ceiling so it roughly tracks plausible long-term demand is key to avoiding multi-year runaway.

## Summary

Parameter choices implicitly select for certain behavioral patterns:

- **High uncertainty and churn expected** → tilt toward **lower cash-out tax**, accept more redemptions, and lean on floor mechanics to reward those who stay.
- **Strong long-term growth expected** → design for:
  - a **modest-high cash-out tax** (to reward stayers and enable loans)
  - an issuance schedule that doesn't outpace realistic demand (to avoid runaway)
  - clear UX around loans as the primary liquidity mechanism that preserves exposure
