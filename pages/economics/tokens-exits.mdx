# Issuance & Redemption Mechanics

This page documents the protocol mechanics for token distribution and redemption parameters.

<MintFlowDiagram />

## Split %

Each time someone pays into the curve, the protocol mints new tokens and splits them:

- A fraction routes to a predefined list of recipients (team, partners, other contracts).
- The remainder routes to the payer.

Properties:

- Splits **do not change the treasury**—they only affect _who_ receives the new tokens.
- From the payer's perspective, a higher split is equivalent to a higher effective price.
- Splits do **not** affect whether the price floor rises from an issuance—that depends on whether the issuance price exceeds the current backing ratio.

### Split Ranges

**Low split (5–20%)**

- Most new tokens route to payers → broad distribution.
- Common in Launchpad-style or community-first configurations.

**Moderate split (40–50%)**

- Payers and existing stakeholders both receive significant shares on each payment.
- Typical for periodic funding configurations where each round both funds the treasury and allocates to incumbents.

**High split (95–98%)**

- Nearly all new tokens route to the operator.
- Payers receive small cashback-style amounts; suitable for loyalty programs and commerce.

Design considerations:

- Splits fund **ongoing work** (salaries, development, operations).
- Predictable splits ("team receives 30% of all new tokens, forever") are easier to model.

## Auto-issuance

Auto-issuance (automint) schedules one-off token mints at stage start. These mints:

- Increase **supply** without adding to the **treasury**.
- Therefore **always reduce the price floor**, because `floor ≈ treasury ÷ supply` and only the denominator changes.

### Use Cases

**Common reasons:**

- Compensate pre-launch contributors who took early risk.
- Allocate to strategic partners or infrastructure providers.

**Design considerations:**

- Keep auto-issuance **minimal** relative to expected future supply.
- Earlier issuance (before significant participation) reduces floor impact on existing holders.
- In multi-stage configurations, scheduling auto-issuance **after** periods of activity gives the floor headroom to absorb dilution.

Framing: **splits for ongoing work; auto-issuance for prior contributions**.

## Cash-out Tax

When someone redeems tokens, the curve calculates a payout based on `treasury ÷ supply`, then applies a **cash-out tax**. A fraction stays in the treasury; the rest goes to the redeemer.

Key property: **Every redemption raises the price floor** as long as the tax is &gt;&nbsp;0. Treasury decreases, but supply decreases _faster_, because some of the payout remains inside.

Higher tax = stronger floor lift per redemption, but higher cost to redeem.

### Low (0–8%)

- Redemptions are inexpensive; tokens function more like a currency.
- Suitable for **Stable Commerce** configurations where participants need to move in and out freely.
- The floor still increases over time through activity, but more gradually.

### Medium (8–20%)

- Each redemption meaningfully benefits remaining holders.
- Loans remain viable for many configurations.
- Suitable for **Periodic Fundraising** systems—participants can remain between rounds but retain the ability to leave.

### High (20–40%+)

- Redemptions become costly; the mechanism favors longer-term holding.
- In Launchpad simulations, tax ≥20% improved capital preservation and floor growth.
- Above ~40%, an interesting property emerges: for large holders, **loans can provide more immediate liquidity than redemption**. The system remains solvent (defaults actually strengthen the floor), but loans become an alternative liquidity path.

## Tax and Loan Interactions

Loans are not configured directly, but their properties depend on tax and ceiling parameters:

- **Higher tax** accelerates floor growth for remaining holders, but raises the appreciation threshold needed for loans to be preferable over redemption.
- **Growing ceiling** gives holders reason to borrow instead of redeem, as future price increases may outpace the loan's cost.
