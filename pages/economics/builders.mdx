# Builders Payouts [Ways to get working capital]

_Hold vs Sell vs Cash-out vs Loan - for long-term contributors_

This page covers **what's rational for builders** to do with their split share once the cobuild is live, assuming:

- High conviction over a 5-10 year horizon
- A meaningful split (often 10-40% of supply early on)

**TL;DR**

- If you believe the cobuild will grow over years, your default is:  
  **hold most of your split, use loans for working capital, and sell only when you consciously want to reduce exposure.**
- Cash-outs are a clean way to exit but remove treasury; loans give you liquidity _and_ support the floor.
- Occasional AMM sells are fine for liquidity needs; just don't turn your founder stack into a constant sell wall.

## Your Split

Your split is not "free tokens." Each token is:

- **Tied to treasury assets** via a redemption mechanism<sup>[4]</sup>
- A **source of borrowing power**, because loans are priced off that same curve and are designed to be over-collateralized

What you do with those tokens feeds back into everyone else's position:

- **Cash-outs (redemptions)**
  - Burn your tokens
  - Pay you from the treasury
  - Designed to _increase_ the floor price for remaining holders, because supply falls faster than the treasury

- **Loans**
  - Burn your collateral at origination
  - Lend you _less_ than you'd get from redeeming
  - Also _increase_ the floor at origination (same mechanics as a discounted cash-out, plus loan fees)

- **AMM sells**
  - Do **not** touch the treasury at all
  - Just move tokens from you to someone else inside the corridor between floor and ceiling
  - Floor and treasury stay unchanged

So you're always trading off:

> **Personal liquidity now** vs **future upside + network health**.

## Basic Moves

With split tokens you can:

### Hold

Do nothing. You stay fully exposed to:

- Rising issuance price (ceiling)
- Activity-driven floor growth from other people's issuances, cash-outs, and loans

Good if:

- You don't need cash right now
- You're maximally bullish and happy being "all-in" on upside

### Cash-out

Burn tokens and withdraw base asset at the bonding-curve price minus cash-out tax and protocol fees.

- You receive slightly _less_ than the backing value per token
- The tax stays in the treasury → designed to increase the floor for those who stay
- When the tax is > 0, the mechanics are structured so that each cash-out can raise the per-token redemption value for remaining holders

Use this when:

- You **intentionally want to reduce exposure** (e.g. stepping back or leaving the project)
- You're okay with "selling" some upside to reward remaining holders

### AMM Sell

Swap tokens at the current market price (between floor and ceiling).

- No cash-out tax
- Treasury & floor don't change
- You just move tokens from "you" to "someone else"

Best for:

- **Small, periodic liquidity needs** (taxes, personal runway)
- Situations where there's good AMM liquidity and you don't want to touch the treasury

### Loan

Use tokens as collateral to borrow from the treasury instead of exiting. See [Loans](/economics/loans) for full details on fee structure and costs.

- Collateral is **burned** at origination
- You can borrow up to ~63-95% of your cash-out value (depending on loan duration)
- When you repay, collateral is **reminted** to you

Intuition:

> A loan is like selling your tokens at a discount now **with the option** to buy them back later at today's floor price, plus a fixed fee.

## Default Strategy

If you have 5-10 year conviction, the baseline play is:

> **Hold most of your split; use loans to fund work and salary; sell rarely and deliberately.**

From the math, a loan beats holding when you can deploy borrowed capital at a return that exceeds the loan fees — roughly **5-6%/yr** for long-term loans, **11-13%/yr** for short-term. See [Loans](/economics/loans) for the exact thresholds.

## Founder Salary

Suppose you're a founder with a big split and you just want to pay yourself a normal salary.

### Option 1: Sell

Pros:

- You get full AMM/floor value today
- No future obligation
- Simple to reason about

Cons:

- You permanently reduce your future upside
- If you sell heavily, you become your own sell pressure

This is "classic equity sell-down": safe but de-levered.

### Option 2: Loan

Here you:

- Borrow against a portion of your stack (say 10-30% of your split)
- Use that to pay yourself over some years
- Plan to repay from future revenue or occasional, smaller token sales

Mentally, you're doing:

> "I'm selling a chunk of my tokens at a discount **to my future self**, not to the market."

Rational when:

1. You expect the floor to grow steadily (a few % per year or more), and
2. You're confident your future income (from the project or otherwise) can handle eventual repayment.

If things go well:

- Floor grows, your salary was funded, and you still own most of your original position at a much higher value.
- The ~37-40% fee on a 10-year loan looks cheap in hindsight.

If things go poorly:

- Floor stagnates or falls
- Repaying hurts, and defaulting effectively means "I sold those tokens years ago at ~60-65% of what I could have redeemed then"
- System stays solvent; you just own less of it

That's the real trade:

> **Debt + more upside** vs **no debt + less upside**.

### Option 3: Hybrid

A very sane founder pattern:

- Use **small, rolling loans** on a minority of your stack (10-30%)
- Keep the rest unlevered
- Re-assess annually: only roll or increase if floor growth and cashflow actually support it

This keeps you:

- Aligned for the long term
- Liquid enough to live
- Away from "all-in leveraged founder" risk

## System Effects

<BuilderFloorEffect />

From the formal analysis, different actions affect the floor and treasury in predictable ways:

- **Issuance (users buying from the cobuild)**
  - Increases treasury and supply
  - Increases the floor whenever issuance price > current backing per token

- **Cash-outs (including yours)**
  - Reduce both treasury and supply
  - Designed to _increase_ the floor when there's a cash-out tax

- **Loan originations**
  - Reduce treasury and supply (collateral burned, funds lent out)
  - Designed to _increase_ the floor due to over-collateralization and fees

- **Loan repayments**
  - Increase treasury and supply (collateral reminted)
  - Slightly _reduce_ the floor vs the origination point, though the prepaid/time fees keep the full loan cycle net-positive for the system

- **Auto-issuances**
  - Increase supply with no treasury inflow
  - Mechanically _decrease_ the floor and should be used sparingly

Implication for builders:

- **Best for network & you**: use loans for working capital, repay when the project is healthy.
- **Neutral**: occasional AMM sells.
- **Heavy early redemptions and big auto-issuances**: mechanically drag on the system and should be reserved for exceptional cases.
