# Loans

Cobuild loans don't have a floating APR. They're **fixed-fee loans with a tunable fee-free window and a hard 10-year limit**.

The upfront payment (the **source fee**) is configurable. It determines the **interest-free period**. After that period, an additional time-based source fee ramps up until a cap, and after 10 years the loan can no longer be repaid (it's administratively liquidated).

## How It Works

High-level:

- Tokens are used as collateral to borrow the base asset from the treasury **instead of** cashing out.
- The collateral is **burned at origination**.
- The **maximum borrowable amount before fees** is the **cash-out value** of that collateral on the bonding curve.
- After protocol / REV / source fees, the participant receives a percentage of the cash-out value:
  - **Short window (~6 months)** → ~94%
  - **Max window (10 years)** → ~63%

So the participant is effectively accessing liquidity at a **discount to the cash-out value**, with the option to restore their position later by repaying the loan.

On repayment:

- The participant chooses how much collateral to restore.
- That fraction of the original collateral is **reminted**, and the loan obligation shrinks accordingly.
- Full repayment before the 10-year deadline restores all collateral.
- After 10 years, the loan can be liquidated: accounting is updated, collateral remains burned, and the treasury stays solvent.

**Intuition:**

A loan ≈ _"access liquidity at a discount today, while preserving the option to restore the original token balance later at (roughly) today's floor price, plus a fixed fee."_

## Fee Layers

When a loan is originated, three fees are deducted from the loan amount immediately:

| Fee type         | Approx %                          | Paid to          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Protocol fee** | ≈ **2.4%**                        | $NANA / Juicebox |
| **REV fee**      | ≈ **1.0%**                        | $REV revnet      |
| **Source fee**   | ≈ **2.4% – 33.3%** (configurable) | The cobuild      |

After fees, the participant receives:

- **Short window (~6 months)** → ~94% of the cash-out value
- **Max window (10 years)** → ~63% of the cash-out value

**Minimum upfront cost (6-month config):**

- Protocol + REV + smallest source fee
- ≈ 2.4% + 1.0% + 2.4% ≈ **5.9% of the amount borrowed**

## Prepaid Duration

The chosen **source fee** determines the **fee-free repayment window**:

| Source fee | Fee-free window |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| ~2.4%      | ~6 months       |
| ~5%        | ~1 year         |
| ~9%        | ~2 years        |
| ~20%       | ~5 years        |
| ~33%       | ~10 years       |

**After the prepaid window ends:**

- A **time-based source fee** starts accruing.
- It ramps up smoothly from 0 and, at the 10-year limit, can add **up to ~50% of the _un-prepaid_ portion** of the loan as extra source fee.
- For typical configurations, **total source fees over 10 years fall in the 50–65% of principal range**, depending on the initial prepayment amount.

There is **no compounding APR**. The structure is:

> upfront % → X years of "no additional interest" → after that a growing late fee accrues, capped by the 10-year limit.

## Cost by Horizon

A property of the fee formulas:

**For a given repayment horizon T, the minimum-cost configuration is always "prepay exactly T years".** Under-prepaying and repaying late is strictly more expensive.

Key horizons, assuming repayment by the end of the prepaid window:

### 5-Year Loan

- ~**20% source fee** → **5-year** fee-free window.
- Total one-time cost (protocol + REV + source):
  ≈ 2.4% + 1.0% + 20% ≈ **23–24% of the amount borrowed**.
- Simple average over 5 years: **~4.7%/yr** (non-compounding).

### 10-Year Loan

- ~**33% source fee** → **10-year** fee-free window.
- Total one-time cost (protocol + REV + source):
  ≈ 2.4% + 1.0% + 33.3% ≈ **~36–37% of the amount borrowed**.
- Simple average over 10 years: **~3.7%/yr**.

### Under-Prepaying

Example: a **6-month** prepay (~2.4% source fee) with actual repayment **5 years** later:

- Total cost on that 5-year horizon ≈ **37% of principal**
  (vs ~23–24% with a 5-year prepay).
- Simple average: **~7.4%/yr**.

A 6-month prepay extended to the **10-year limit** results in ≈ **55% total cost** of principal.

The mechanism is designed such that:

> Matching the prepaid window to the actual repayment horizon minimizes total fees. Under-prepaying and repaying late always costs more in total percentage terms.

## Loan Use Cases

The loan mechanism serves several practical purposes:

- **Working capital**: Builders who need liquidity for operations without permanently reducing their position.
- **Bridging timing gaps**: When a participant expects future income but needs funds now.
- **Maintaining alignment**: Accessing liquidity while preserving the option to restore one's original token balance later.

The fixed-fee structure makes costs predictable—participants know the total cost at origination rather than facing variable rate uncertainty.

## 10-Year Mechanism Properties

With the max-prepay 10-year configuration:

- The participant pays **~36–37% of the cash-out value** of their collateral as a one-time fee, in exchange for **10 years of liquidity**.
- The mechanism preserves:
  - The option to restore the original token balance at any point before the deadline.
  - The repayment amount is fixed at origination—it does not change if the floor moves.

This design allows long-duration liquidity access while keeping costs bounded and predictable.

## Rolling Loans

Participants **can refinance**, but **cannot reuse the same collateral twice**:

- Collateral is burned and tied to a specific loan until repayment or default.
- To open a new loan:
  - Repay the existing loan,
  - Collateral is reminted,
  - A new loan can then be opened at the current floor.

Each cycle:

- Incurs a fresh set of fees.
- Reduces the participant's net token position over time.

The **loan → repay → loan** pattern allows participants to access liquidity across multiple periods while maintaining their token balance.

## TL;DR

- No floating APR; a **front-loaded fee** determines the **fee-free repayment window (up to 10 years)**.
- Protocol + REV fees total **~3.4%** on top of the chosen source fee.
- When **prepay matches horizon and repayment is on time**:
  - ~6-month: **~6%** total cost.
  - **5-year**: **~23–24%** total (~4.7%/yr simple).
  - **10-year**: **~36–37%** total (~3.7%/yr simple).
- **Under-prepaying with late repayment** increases total cost (e.g. 6-month prepay with 5-year repay → ~37% total; 6-month prepay extended to 10 years → ~55% total).
- **No compounding interest** and no unbounded debt growth; everything is bounded by the 10-year design.

All percentages are of the **amount borrowed** and exclude gas and token price volatility; rounded for clarity, but the structure matches the cobuild math.
