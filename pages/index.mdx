# A Cobuilder's Manifesto

> I see in you the strongest and smartest people who've ever lived.  
> I see all this potential, and I see it squandered.  
> God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables. Slaves with white collars.  
> Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. <sup>[[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyRpj-971o)</sup>

We're all trapped in a race to the bottom.
A downward-spiral of incentives that erodes human values until we're nothing but consumers.
To survive in these systems is to destroy the planet, fray our minds, and empty our communities.
No one is in control, and still the machine marches on.

We built that machine out of a 20th-century invention: the corporation.
Companies exist to lower the costs of coordination, but artificial intelligence, global networks, and programmable money are driving those costs to zero.

Now strangers from across the globe can share value directly and coordinate through software instead of hierarchy. This makes space for a new kind of organization: one that turns shared belief into impact, and impact into upside for everyone who contributes.

Our vision is a network of mission-driven organizations where millions of people earn a living advancing goals they deeply care about.
Something that feels more like a tribe and less like a 9 to 5.
Sustainable systems of belief that protect human values instead of sacrificing them.
Cultures that reward honesty, stewardship, and courage as strongly as today's markets reward profit at any cost.

For the first time in human history, we can turn subcultures into livelihoods and values into incentives.
We can rewrite the reward function of civilization.

We commit to using the tools of the intelligence age to design and deploy these new organizations responsibly, so anyone, anywhere can earn a living building for the values they believe in, and benefit all of humanity in the process.
