# Revenue network [Real activity, real value]

## Beyond speculation

On a typical bonding curve, the only thing propping up the price is the willingness of later buyers to subsidize earlier ones.
Hype is the main input.
With Cobuild, the input that matters most is real economic activity.

<RevenueFloorChart />

Whenever someone routes revenue or raises money, the treasury grows, and with it the cash-out floor for every holder.
The "worst case" for holders improves as the project actually does business, sells products, runs campaigns, charges fees.
Those flows are captured onchain, and **everyone has an incentive to share revenue.**

The incentive flips from pure greater-fool speculation to something with real skin in the game: help the network earn and propagate, and the minimum you can walk away with increases as long as money keeps flowing through the rails.

## Supercharged buybacks

Anyone in the community can build products and services that feed the treasury.
The mechanism is simple: when you sell something, route a portion of revenue to mint the network's token.

This creates a direct link between your commercial success and the network's growth.
You're not asking for permission or applying for a grant. You're building a business that automatically compounds value back to the community.

### Why would you do this?

**Build equity as you sell.** Every sale builds your stake in the network you're helping grow.

**Supercharged customer rewards.** You can split the minted tokens between yourself and your customers. A customer who buys your product doesn't just get the product, they get tokens backed by real treasury value.

**No gatekeepers.** You don't need approval to start. The protocol is permissionless. Build what you want, price it how you want, set your revenue split how you want.

### How it works

1. **Sell your product or service.** Use the network's brand, tooling, and community.

2. **Decide your percentage.** Maybe 10% of each sale goes back to the network.

3. **Buy back the token.** Route that percentage to mint or buy tokens from the network. Split them between yourself and your customer.

4. **Everyone wins.** You get tokens. Your customers get tokens. The treasury grows. The floor rises for everyone.

Unlike traditional stock buybacks, revenue routed to the treasury is designed to back the redemption value. Under normal operation, redemptions are structured to increase the per-token floor for remaining holders.

### Example

You sell a product for $100. You've configured a 10% revenue split to the treasury.

- $10 routes to mint network tokens
- You receive 70% of those tokens (~$7 worth at floor)
- Your customer receives 30% (~$3 worth at floor)
- The customer got the product plus a stake in the network
- You built equity while running your business
- The treasury grew by $10, lifting the floor for all holders

The customer's "rewards" aren't inflated loyalty points. They're tokens backed by the very revenue their purchase contributed.

Now multiply this across dozens or hundreds of builders. Each one selling their own products, routing their own revenue. Your customer's tokens don't just benefit from your sales. They benefit from every sale across the entire network.

This is why customers are more likely to buy: they're not just getting your product, they're holding the same token that ties into activity across the entire network—not just your sales.

## A different kind of network

This model inverts the typical platform relationship.

On traditional platforms, you build on someone else's rails and they extract value from your work.
Here, you build on shared rails and the value you create flows back to you, your customers, and **everyone else building on the network.**

The brand is in the public domain. The treasury is transparent. The rules are encoded, not negotiated.

You're not a tenant. You're a participant building stake alongside a team of thousands with every transaction.

**This is the positive-sum future Cobuild enables.**
