# Zero Governance [Incentive alignment without governance]

Most tokenized networks entangle participants in bespoke governance and liquidity games.
Someone can change parameters mid‑flight, pull liquidity, or rewrite the rules once enough value is in the system.
Staking rewards and buybacks are subject to the same risks.

That uncertainty is another hidden tax on coordinators: you spend attention modeling the humans behind the contract instead of the contract itself.

Cobuild strips the problem down to a small, inspectable machine: a schedule for how expensive new tokens are, a rule for how cash‑outs work, and an optional split that decides who shares in new issuance.

Once deployed, no one can arbitrarily move the goalposts.
Cobuild aligns long-term participants, builders, and users with hard-coded incentives.
