# Why Crypto [Understanding onchain fundraising]

Crypto quietly smuggled a new institution onto the internet: anyone can spin up an asset for an idea, push it onto a global market, and have strangers fund it in seconds.

Networks can raise capital not by pitching incumbents, but by selling liquid slices of their story directly to the crowd.
A token becomes a tiny, tradable claim on "this should exist," and 24/7 global markets decide in real time how much that belief is worth.

Seen this way, blockchains aren't just shared computers; they're capital formation machines.
They collapse the distance between "we want to do this" and "we have the funds to make it happen," turning culture and conviction into balance sheet on demand.

Modern coordination, at its core, is two loops: pull capital in (and keep it flowing), then route it toward the work that matters.

Crypto has made the first loop radically easier, but mostly in crude, speculative ways.
Our bet with Cobuild is to close that loop properly: new primitives for allocating capital with high signal, and a new primitive for raising it: revenue networks that let communities plug their real economic activity into onchain rails and turn it into long-term value.
