# Issues Today [Problems with token issuance]

Most token launchpads and ERC20 sales today are optimized for speculation, not coordination.
They compress the entire funding event into a few minutes, where "being early" means having the right bot and latency setup rather than actually understanding what's being built.

Bonding curves and pump.fun style launches structurally reward whoever's bots show up first, then shift the risk onto everyone who arrives seconds later.
There's no built‑in floor, no obligation from the treasury back to the people who funded it, and once the initial hype passes, late participants are often left holding assets that can drift toward zero with no recourse.

The mechanism treats attention and speed as the scarce resource, not long‑term conviction or contribution.

On top of that, these launches make it hard for founders to get fair, durable working capital.
Teams pre‑mint massive allocations to themselves and gradually dump into their own community's bids just to pay for actual work.
The cleanest way to stay solvent becomes selling into your earliest supporters.

Meanwhile, every project reinvents its own tokenomics: bespoke vesting, ad‑hoc discounts, governance wrappers, hidden admin keys.
Participants have to reason about opaque human promises layered on top of fragile liquidity games.

The result is a funding stack that's great at spinning up short‑lived casinos, but bad at aligning builders, participants, and users around something that can compound over years.

Cobuild is an attempt to solve these issues and more.
