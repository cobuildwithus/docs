# Working Capital [Pay the bills without selling]

A major failure mode of existing token launches is how founders get working capital.
To pay for work, teams pre‑mint huge allocations to themselves and periodically dump into their own community's bids.

The **cleanest way for a founder to pay rent is to sell out the people who believed earliest.**

## Splits

Cobuild solves this dynamic.
Each Cobuild token can specify how newly minted tokens are split: a fixed share of every new issuance is earmarked to fund builders, and that rule is locked in at deploy time.

For example, with a 20% split rate, when someone buys 100 tokens, 20 tokens automatically route to builders.

## Cashing out

When you need working capital, you can cash out against the treasury instead of dumping on the market.
You pay a small exit tax that stays in the treasury, raising the floor for all remaining holders.

Instead of selling out early believers, you get capital and everyone else's position improves.

## Loans

More powerfully, anyone can use their tokens as collateral for loans instead of market‑selling.
Cobuild natively enables loans backed by each token's treasury.

Lock your tokens, take cash from the treasury, use it for a year or two to fund operations, pay back the loan, and your original tokens return to your wallet. You never lost your position. You never sold anything.

As a builder, you mortgage your future contribution to the network, not your community's trust. The interest paid on those loans feeds back into the treasury, nudging the floor higher for all holders.
