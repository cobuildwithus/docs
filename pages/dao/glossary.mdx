# Glossary

**Goal**  
The root goal with a treasury, oracleable success condition, and deadline.

**Budget**  
A budget/strategy under a Goal with its own goal, invariants, treasury, and child registry.

**Allocation Mechanism**  
A payout mechanism inside a budget ([Flow](/allocation/flows), [Round](/allocation/rounds)).

**Stake weight**  
The active amount used in pro-rata routing. Can be changed to reroute streams.

**Stake exposure**  
Escrowed principal locked until resolution. Determines risk and conviction.

**Conviction**  
Time-weighted accumulation over exposure (e.g., stake-seconds).

**Reward escrow / reward pool**  
The reserved portion of Goal inflows (20%) distributed to underwriters if the Goal succeeds.

**Reward points**  
Accounting units (optionally tokenized) minted/assigned on budget success and redeemable at Goal success.

**Streamable balance**  
Treasury balance minus RewardEscrow and any reserved balances; used to compute Goal outflow.

**Spendable balance**  
Treasury balance minus local reserves; used to compute budget outflow during execution.

**TCR (Token Curated Registry)**  
A token curated registry with challenge windows and oracle-based dispute resolution.

**Budget_TCR**  
Registry of budgets under a Goal.

**Allocation_TCR**  
Registry of allocation mechanisms under a budget.

**Activation threshold (minBudget)**  
Minimum balance a budget must reach before it can begin spending.

**Runway cap (maxBudget)**  
A throttle that pauses upstream inflow when a treasury balance is above a threshold.

**Lifetime spend cap (budgetCap)**  
Optional maximum cumulative spend used for efficiency weighting or hard limits.

**Eligible child**  
A listed child with sufficient stake and not currently capped; only eligible children receive streams.
